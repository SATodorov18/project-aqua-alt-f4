            Bulgaria has quite specific geographic situation, being in the outheast outlying part of Europe, rather close to the Asian continent and near proximity to the subtropical Mediterranean region. 
            It gives grounds for rapid change of the climate from north to south. 
            In climatic aspect the major part of the country belongs to the European moderate-continental zone. 
            The southmost and southeastern regions are under the strong influence of the Mediterranean continental-subtropical zone.

            The Bulgarian river watersheds belong to three major basins: the Danube river basin; the Black Sea basin; Aegean Sea basin. 
            The position of those three basins is shown by different color tones on the picture below. 
            The precipitation is relatively well annually distributed the high and low flow periods are quite well outlined, mostly because of the evaporation conditions.
