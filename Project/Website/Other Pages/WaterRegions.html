            Bulgaria has quite specific geographic situation, being in the outheast outlying part of Europe, rather close to the Asian continent and near proximity to the subtropical Mediterranean region. 
            It gives grounds for rapid change of the climate from north to south. 
            In climatic aspect the major part of the country belongs to the European moderate-continental zone. 
            The southmost and southeastern regions are under the strong influence of the Mediterranean continental-subtropical zone.
