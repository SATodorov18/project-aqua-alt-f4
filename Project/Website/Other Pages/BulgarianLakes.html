          <p class="text-p">
            Lake Atanasovsko is a salt coastal lake north of Burgas, Bulgaria, located in direct proximity to the Black Sea. 
            The lake is about 5 km long and divided in two by a strip of sand in the middle. 
            The lake is particularly known for the diversity of its flora and fauna and is surrounded by swamps and canals that drain the whole local basin into the sea.
