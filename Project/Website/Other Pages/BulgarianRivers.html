            The Iskar is a right tributary of the Danube. With a length of 368 km it is the longest river that runs entirely within Bulgaria. 
            Originating as three forks in Balkan's highest mountain range Rila, it flows in northern direction until its confluence with the Danube River. 
            As it flows northwards it fuels the largest artificial lake in the country, the Iskar Reservoir, forms the divide between the Vitosha and Plana Mountains.
